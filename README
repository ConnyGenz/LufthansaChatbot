# .env file

This project uses APIs and services for which accounts, passwords and API keys are required.
These need to be specified in a `.env` file. This file also contains parameters of the project,
namely some paths to source data and the names of the language models to be used.

The **.env file** may be requested from the author of this repository, or it may be created by
users of this project who are going to use their own accounts and API keys.
